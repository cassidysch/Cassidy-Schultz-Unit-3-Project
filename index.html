            <h1>You and your friend are working the night shift in a small-town grocery store. You’ve known them for so long that they’re like another sibling to you, but you’ve been fighting a lot lately. <br><br> Your shift is almost over, thank God, but you hear a strange sound coming from outside… What will you do?</h1>

            <h1 class="Atext">"Hey what's that sound?" your friend asks. "I'll go check it out." You stroll over to the door casually. As you peer out into the desolate parking lot, you see a group of people sprinting towards you. They see your face and start shouting and waving their arms around wildly. You rest your hands on the push bar and crane your neck to see what they're running from. You see another group emerge from the darkness behind them, but as you look closer, it becomes clear that there is something glaringly wrong about them. <br><br>Some drag their arms drag by their sides and some claw out in front of them, their skin is sickly and lifeless, and their clothes are ripped and torn where sickening wounds lay below. You feel your knees start to give out as you realize it... THEY'RE ZOMBIES!</h1>

            <h1 class="spaghetti-text"> You lift your hands off the door and the strangers rush inside in a flurry of relief and thank-yous. You and your friend slam the door shut behind them and pull an ice cream freezer over to act as a barricade, thus trapping everybody inside the supermarket. "We don't know where they came from, but those zombies charged us while we were at the mall and we decided to come to the safest place we could imagine: a grocery store," one of the strangers explains. <br> <br> "Hey, are we done talking?" another stranger starts to say, "'cause I don't feel soo goooddd...." Their speech slurs into a deep, guttural growl as their skin turns to a putrid shade of green. They snarl and claw out at you, revealing a nasty bite-mark on their forearm. You shriek in horror as they LUNGE for your friend! At the same time, you hear the front entrance door shatter as the zombies ram their bodies against it. You can either save your friend from the zombie or throw something at the door to prevent the zombies from breaching the store. </h1>

There's a back door that leads outside!" You take the crowd of uninfected and safely escape out the exit into the night. <br><br> The End</h1>

The zombies had caught up to the crowd and you and your friend watch in terror as the crowd loses a brutal battle against the zombies. Your friend calls the local authorities to alert them that the two of you are both still alive and wait until the military comes to pick you up. <br><br> The End</h1>

If you shove your friend outside to face the zombies alongside the other uninfected, you'll be able to lock yourself inside and survive for twice as long as you wait for the authorities.

You watch from behing the register as a zombie grabs your friend by the shoulders and takes a bite out of their neck. You shudder in horror and steathily slip away, running through the aisles and nearly tripping over stray cans of food. You find the back exit and heave it open.

A zombie tumbles towards you and you bring the broom down on the zombie's head, sending the zombie falling to the ground. Another zombie reaches out and grabs you firmly by the arm. You stick out the broom and spin hard into the zombie, feeling the broomstick collide with it's stomach like a bag of rice. It lets out a long groan and shrivels to the ground in pain. You look around at these strangers as they scream battle cries and fight with valor and feel a strong sense of pride. Suddenly, you feel a mind-numbing pain in your shoulder. You cry out and collapse to the ground as a zombie looms over you in satisfaction. The world around you fades into darkness and you slip away into a deep sleep. <br> <br> The End</h1>
